[NAME:Bourbon's March of Wrath]
[DESCRIPTION:A total conversion of Dwarf Fortress for a more classical world.]

[STEAM_TITLE:Bourbon's March of Wrath]
[STEAM_DESCRIPTION:Tired of vanilla DF, but not wanting to go too far down the rabbit hole of high fantasy? Want to play races other than dwarves, or wanting a new twist on dwarves as you know it? Want a more European fantasy feeling with less durian fruit or capybaras? Want your elves little less silly, and a bit more Silmarillion?

[STEAM_CHANGELOG:Custom metals no longer re-indexing due to a duplicate SILVER entry. Value of silver increased to 15.]
