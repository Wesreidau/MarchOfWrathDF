Rights to the "March of Wrath" setting are reserved by the author, Bourbon. Who knows, I might write a book.

No hateful or dehumanizing content is directed against any groups or individuals existing in our world, living or dead, and any
similarities are purely coincidental. Content in this mod is not intended to be more disturbing beyond such content
published in the vanilla game.

You are free to mod out any specific element you find objectionable, or add in any content which was removed, in your local copy.

Compensation for emotional damages from the use of this modification are limited to one mermaid bone earring.

It is in the gigachad modder's "I stole your code / Its not my code" mindset that I grant you permission to reverse-engineer
my reverse-engineering for your own projects. Any sufficiently tangental development requires no credit, appreciated though it is.

However, I have seen many nice Workshop mods end up diminishing with the march of the game's progress, including a few I created.
It is not uncommon that a fan hesitates to re-upload a mod with a fix out of fear of appearing to be somehow unseemly.

For the sake of longevity and to ease the mind of a future caretaker...

Should this workshop mod fall into inactivity or incompatibility with future versions of Dwarf Fortress, permission is granted to:

1. Create a compatibility patch (ie "March of Wrath 51.0x (Unofficial)"), provided adequate attribution.
2. Upload a version made compatible with the current version of Dwarf Fortress, provided adequate attribution.
3. Said patches or compatible versions will be removed from the public (but may be kept or shared privately)
   at the specific request of the author "Bourbon", such as but not limited to the original mod being updated.

Provide adequate attribution is defined as;
	A. A designation as "Unofficial" or similar in the Steam Workshop.
	B. A link to the original workshop mod in the Steam Workshop mod description.

Thanks to the tireless DF wiki contributors hauling modding tokens up from the fathomless depths.

Lucky delving in the RAWs to you all.
